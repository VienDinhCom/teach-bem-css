# Teach BEM CSS

I spent some time teaching two students how to build a simple blog, and honestly, it was a good reminder that clean code matters more than clever code.

We used BEM—a naming system that keeps your CSS from becoming a tangled mess. Think of it like labeling your moving boxes clearly instead of just throwing everything in.

The workspace ran on Gulp to automate the boring stuff. Handlebars helped us template the HTML, Sass kept our styles organized. We also set up htmllint, stylelint, and eslint—basically spell-checkers for code that catch mistakes before they become problems.

Nothing fancy, just a blog. But that's the point. Good foundations don't need to be complicated. The students walked away knowing how to structure their work so they can actually maintain it six months later. That's the real skill.
